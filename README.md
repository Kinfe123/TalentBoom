# TalentBoom

TalentBoom is a web application built with ReactJS, Supabase, and Clerk that aims to provide free and quality education resources to African students to help them acquire relevant skills for the job market.

## Problem
Access to quality education is a major challenge for millions of students in sub-Saharan Africa. Many students lack financial aid, access to resources, and support in their pursuit of education and job opportunities. Additionally, the cost of higher education is often unaffordable for many students and their families.

## Solution
TalentBoom provides free educational resources that can be filtered based on the needs of African students. The platform offers detailed roadmaps and required resources on how to learn specific skills. Additionally, the app provides small groups with a mentor who has mastered the skill to provide support and guidance to African students.
